# Zxcvbn

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/zxcvbn.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/zxcvbn)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/formigarafa/zxcvbn-rb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/formigarafa/zxcvbn-rb)

Ruby port of Dropbox's [zxcvbn.js](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) JavaScript library running completely in Ruby (no need to load execjs or libv8).

The intention is to provide an option 100% Ruby solution with all the same features and same results (or as close to the original JS function as possible).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zxcvbn'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zxcvbn

### Compatible with `zxcvbn-js` and `zxcvbn-ruby`

This gem include a compatible interface so it can be used as a drop-in substitution for `zxcvbn-js` or `zxcvbn-ruby`. You can just call `Zxcvbn.test` or use `Zxcvbn::Tester.new` the same way as you would if you were using `zxcvbn-js` or `zxcvbn-ruby`.
